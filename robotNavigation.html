    <h1>Robotic Localization and Mapping</h1>
    <body>
        In this project, muktiple theories and techniques were implemted
         to program a differential drive robot to navigate an enclosed environment.  The robot 
        was able to move in the environment without collisions using lidar sensor data and wall
        following behavior. The robot was able to identify landmarks using lidar sensor data and 
        complete topological path planning by successfully following a set of navigational commands at 
        environment landmarks. For metric path planning, the robot stored an occupancy grid of the 
        world. A wavefront algorithm was used to create a plan from the robot’s given start position to a 
        set goal using the occupancy grid. The robot was successfully able to navigate the environment 
        to the given goal position using this map. Communication between the user and robot was 
        facilitated with a GUI that sent data from the user’s laptop to the robot’s microcontroller via 
        Bluetooth connection.

        <p>The robot read in a .txt file, containing an 8x8 arrary with the topological
            map encoding. The array contained integers to represent different configuations
            the robot could encounter, as shown below. </p>

        <div class = "grid">
            <p>Similarily, the robot could recieve the same size file, but this time containing
            only 0s and 99s. The 0s were used to represent an open space, while the 99s were
            used to represent a space were an obstacle was present. Using the Wavefront algorithm,
            the occupancy grid was able to be populated to give the robot a plan to its 
            goal location. The wavefont algorithm resulted in the following, with the robot's starting
            location in the upper-left hand corner and its goal location in the bottom 
            right corner.</p>

            <div class = "grid">
            <p>A finite state machine was implemented to use the topological map. The sensor
            data from the lidar sensors were used to tell the robot which state it was in. 
            When an object was detected, it was mapped to the following state below. The data was averaged over 7 
            readings to help correct for possible sensor error.</p>

        <h2>Metric Path Following</h2>
            <div class = "grid">
                <p>When the robot was given a start and goal location on the GUI,
                the robot was able to navigate the obstacles, as shown in the video below.
                Since the obstacles were not perfect, mutiple sensors were used to 
                ensure the robot's success. The robot's front, back, right, and left 
                lidar sensor were all used, along with closed loop proportional control to stop the robot 
                from hitting any obstables. These sensors helped correct the error
                that was introduced when the robot turned a corner. 
                Wheel encoders were used calculate determine when the robot 
                had reached its desired angle.</p>

    <h1>GUI</h1>
        <div class = "grid">
            <p>The graphical user interface shown below was implemented in Python using the 
            Tkinter library. 

            On the left, the GUI contains buttons for sending commands to the robot and displays 
            sensor data from the robot. On the right, maps of the world are displayed. The bottom map is the 
            topological map of the world, and the top center map is the occupancy grid of the world. When a 
            start and end goal is sent to the robot using the “Go to Goal” button, the map on the top right 
            updates using wavefront expansion to display the metric path plan the robot will take to reach the 
            goal. 

            Wireless communication was implemented with the HC-06 Bluetooth module. The laptop 
            and HC-06 communicated over the Bluetooth serial port communication. Serial port communication was also used to allow 
            the GUI to commuticated with the C++ algorithms, which controlled the robot.</p>
