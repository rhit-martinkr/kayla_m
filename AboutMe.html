<h1>About Me!</h1>
<p>
    I'm a controls engineer with a passion for problem-solving and innovation. I thrive on tackling complex 
    challenges and designing solutions that make a real-world impact. My background in engineering fuels my 
    curiosity to understand how things work, and I’m always looking for ways to improve systems, tools, and processes.
    I love to learn and am always looking for new opportunities to grow my skill set and learn.
</p>
<p>
    You can often find me outdoors. Whether it’s running
     exploring trails, biking, or kayaking, I’m always up for an adventure. 
     The great outdoors keeps me energized and grounded, and it’s my perfect escape from the daily grind. While 
     I grew up as a swimmer and continued my distance swimming career in college, running has become 
     my current passion. Running is my way 
     to clear my mind and push myself to my limits, but also always me to explore new places. 
    I believe that life is about working hard, exploration, and growing.
