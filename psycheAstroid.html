<h1>Psyche Astroid Sample Return</h1>

    <h2>Design</h2>
    <div class = "grid">
        <p>Psyche is a metal-rich asteroid, currently orbiting the Sun between Mars and Jupiter. Arizona
        State University oversees the missions to explore the asteroid. The first mission is in progress
        and launched in October of 2023 to explore the origin of the asteroid. The second mission will
        return samples of the asteroid to Earth in 2029. Obtaining authentic samples will allow
        researchers to gain a better understanding of the surfaces of the asteroid. A spacecraft will hold
        a sealing system, holding samples after extraction. Our sealing system could be utilized to seal
        and protect samples from contamination.
        The goal of our project is to design a sealing system for collected samples from the Psyche
        asteroid. The final design consists of a fully automated sealing system that maintains the
        integrity of samples from the asteroid. Most of the characteristics of Psyche are only
        hypothesized, such as material and surface texture. We consider such associated technical
        challenges with our design. Challenges for this project include simulating the environment-
        controlled mission’s conditions within the spacecraft, including a wide range of temperatures
        and a low acceleration of gravity. The system aims to function under such extreme conditions in
        addition to remaining cost effective and versatile.</p>

        <h2>Plug Design</h2>
        <div class = "grid">
            <p>Two pieces make up the body of the plug. The plug is design to be placed into a round vial,
            which holds the same. The screw threads the pieces together and
            compresses the O-ring once screwed in. It is important to note the undercuts along the
            circumference of the top of the plug. The grippers hold onto the plug by these undercuts. The
            spring serves to provide uniform force retention and additional support when travelling down the
            vial, while also cleaning the walls of the vial. The plug allows for the sample to be safely 
            returned to Earth, while also protecting it. </p>

        <h2>Automation</h2>
            <p>The linear actuator rod moves the gripper assembly down. The stepper motor controls the
                gears. The gears (pinions) and racks act to form a rack and pinion concept, moving the lowering
                attachment.
                The stepper motor controls the rotation of the gears. The gears allow the racks to open and
                close horizontally. As the racks open, the lowering attachment can directly
                interact with the plug.
                The lowering attachment holds and pushes down the plug. The lowering attachment interacts
                via the undercuts inside the plug to push the plug against the sample within the vial.
                When the racks and lowering attachment are closed, the attachment can fit into the plug.
                The lowering attachment expands against the undercuts of the top portion
                of the plug. The attachment then pushes the plug into the vial and
                further pushes the plug down the vial to meet the sample. Once the plug reaches the sample,
                the racks close again and retract the lowering attachment upward, leaving the plug in the vial.
                For the screwing process, the lowering attachment fully expands to the end of the racks, moving
                out of the way for the screwing attachment to come in.
                A stepper motor in the sealing station rotates the screwing attachment. The screwing
                attachment rotates the screw, ultimately compressing the O-ring and create the seal.

            <p>To fully automate the sealing process, the sealing station detects the orientation of the screw
                head. Based on our design, the screw is inside the vial, without being screwed down all the way
                before the space craft is launched into space. While the space craft travels up, the screw could
                rotate to an unknown position and change orientation. Once the detection of the screw head
                occurs, the screwing attachment’s hex bit matches with the alignment of the screw head and
                screws downward.
                We created an algorithm to detect the orientation of the screw using color detection. The
                algorithm relies on two green dots that are added to the screw head.  </p>
