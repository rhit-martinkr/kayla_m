    In 2016, my mom was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer, and sadly, she lost her battle less than a year later. 
    She was not just an incredible mother; she was a dedicated teacher and a role model in every sense. After my 
    father passed away from cancer in 2005, she raised my twin brother and me as a single mom, instilling in us 
    the values of hard work and determination.
   </ul>
   <ul>
    I feel incredibly fortunate to have had the time I did with her, and I am honored to be running the 
    2025 Chicago Marathon in her memory. I am excited to embark on this journey and raise aware for pancreatic cancer. 
   </ul>
   <ul>
    My mom prioritized family above all else, working tirelessly to ensure that my brother and I had the best childhood possible. 
    Every summer, she would spend her time running my brother and I to swim practices and also prioritizing family time. 
    Some of my favorite memories was our annual family vacations, like the unforgettable trip to Sea World in San Diego 
    and the time we got to explore New York City. 
   </ul>
   <ul>
    Even during her fight against pancreatic cancer, she put us first. Whether it was attending my swim meets between 
    treatments or never missing a band concert, she was our biggest supporter, making every milestone special.
   </ul>
   <ul>
    One of her greatest joys was biking. My parents shared this passion, and even after his passing, 
    she continued to ride. We spent countless hours biking around town whenever the weather was nice. 
    Often, we would visit friends and family, and also enjoyed trying local restaurants along the way. 
    This love for biking is something she passed down to me, and I cherish the moments I spend riding her bike, 
    which was passed down to me. 
   </ul>
   <ul>
    Through her strength and resilience, my mom taught me invaluable lessons about hard work. 
    Despite the grueling chemotherapy sessions that took such a toll on her, she always tried 
    to keep our spirits high. I will never forget the fight attitude that she had. 
   </ul>
   <ul>
    Running has been a big part of my journey and has served as an outlet for me. 
    I am very excited to be running my first marathon in memory of the most important person in 
    my life and for an amazing cause. Pancreatic cancer is one of the most challenging cancers to diagnose and treat,
     and many families have faced a similar struggle to mine. Throughout my journey to raise money and fund my first 
     marathon with Project Purple, I hope to raise awareness and provide support for those battling pancreatic cancer. 
     With your support, I know we can all make a difference.
