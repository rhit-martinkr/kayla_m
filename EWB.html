<h1>Engineers Without Borders</h1>
<h1>El Sembrador School Project</h1>
<p>
    This project is located in the Pastocalle parish, in the Cotopaxi province, within Ecuador. 
    The community consists of mostly lower-income individuals who primarily work in the agricultural sector. 
    Currently the school is not being used and completion of this project will allow the local school systemâ€™s 
    capacity to be expanded by 30% creating additional educational opportunities. The hope is that with the 
    addition of the El Sembrador School, students in the Pastocalle community will not only be able to get a basic 
    education, but also finish high school.

    During our Sprin 2023 Assessment Trip, we collected data to determine the exact project scope, surverying data to
    understand site elevations, geotechnical data using penetration testing, structural measurements, and 
    a variety of non-destructive testing method to understand the strength of the strucutre.
    With all this information, the design of the school was able to begin.

    Multiple fundraisers were also held to help raise money for the project and spread awareness 
    about Engineers Without Border's mission. A monthly newsletter was also created to 
    reach out to alumni and donars.
